Wants/Goals:

Login page: be a popup on index file instead, have a boolean for isLoggedIn, stops popup once you've logged in



Have navbar close if clicking on link of active page (right now it currently relaods it)
-possibly through js? preventDefault()


Have cards expand to reveal more information e.g. steps previews
-right now the "+" just goes to the (empty) task creator
-try using JSON to have the links fill the task creator instead of harcoding/going to a blank creator


Have better/different icons for task groups/types


Implement search bar (functions not for now, but just have it be on right or underneath the navbar); 
-trying to put it in nav puts it at the center when in mobile mode


Update style to fit rest of app (only on index.html right now)


Decide if FAB (floating action button) should go straight to create empty, or if there should be other things (e.g. search, favorites)


Have people counts underneath each task (Wizard of Oz), with maybe a small description
-right now it's only the task title


What happens if there's hundres of tasks? 
-have all be loadble? one infinite page or multiple limited pages?


Fix CSS/styling on side-navbar


Try to move the hamburger menu right just a few pixels
